                    Kyrgyzstan,[A] officially the Kyrgyz Republic,[B] also known as Kirghizia
                    (in Russian),[C] is a landlocked country in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan is bordered
                    by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the south,
                    and China to the east. Its capital and largest city is Bishkek. Ethnic Kyrgyz
                    make up the majority of the country's six million people, followed by significant minorities
                    of Uzbeks and Russians. The Kyrgyz language is closely related to other Turkic languages,
                    although Russian remains spoken and is an official language, a legacy of a century of Russification.
                    90% of Kyrgyzstan's population are Muslim, with the majority of its population following
                    Sunni Islam.[11] In addition to its Turkic origins, Kyrgyz culture bears elements of Iranic,
                    Mongolian and Russian influence.
                    Kyrgyzstan's history spans a variety of cultures and empires.
                    Although geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain,
                    Kyrgyzstan has been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part
                    of the Silk Road and other commercial routes. Inhabited by a succession of tribes
                    and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under larger domination. Between periods
                    of self-government it was ruled by Göktürks, the Uyghur Empire and the Khitan people,
                    before being conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century; it regained independence but
                    was invaded by Kalmyks, Manchus and Uzbeks. In 1876, it became part of the Russian Empire,
                    remaining in the USSR as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic after the Russian Revolution.
                    Following Mikhail Gorbachev's democratic reforms in the USSR, in 1990 pro-independence candidate
                    Askar Akayev was elected president. On 31 August 1991, Kyrgyzstan declared independence
                    from Moscow and a democratic government was established. Kyrgyzstan attained sovereignty as
                    a nation state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                    kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the
                    form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
                    called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries);
                    gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;
                    rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.
                    These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are
                    known as football codes.
                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball
                    games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes
                    of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public
                    schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the
                    British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence
                    outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional
                    codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the
                    rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888,
                    The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
                    associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become
                    some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]
